## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
Learning Coding is a thing that I need to keep seeking for challenges. In order to process a better success in Coding, I have to be a eternal student who can accept mistakes and be positive to search for the reason. Don’t face the problem like it is a problem, face the problem like a incoming bill which is just a little heavy to handle but it is good and all fine.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
It is really hard to talk about myself, but I got comfortable working around these codes through mod0. Everytime we learn something new is excited for me. I have been using computers for years, but right now, I am learning how to look at my screen in a totally different way which shows everything with words!
3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
It was a littble bit confusing me at the beginning, but wasn’t hard to get where I need to go. It helps me getting more familiar with my codes.
4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
a conditional statement can be like turning left or right, if I pick left, I go to the left street and if I pick right, I go to the right one.
5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
using else if and type in the conditions. Program reads them using numbers, I variable them as numbers, program reads the number and determins to do what follows the number.
6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
Logical Operators
7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
